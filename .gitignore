# .yarn/unplugged and .yarn/build-state.yml should likely always be ignored since
# they typically hold machine-specific build artifacts. Ignoring them might however
# prevent Zero-Installs from working (to prevent this, set enableScripts to false).
.yarn/unplugged
.yarn/build-state.yml

# .yarn/cache and .pnp.* may be safely ignored, but you'll need to run yarn install
# to regenerate them between each branch switch.
# Uncomment the following lines if you're not using Zero-Installs:
# .yarn/cache
# .pnp.*
